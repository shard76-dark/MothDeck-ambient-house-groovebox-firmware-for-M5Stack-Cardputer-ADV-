## 1.2.0 (2026-10-09)

A plugin on the card can be a patch: `mothdeck-patch 1` in `/moth/instruments/<folder>/manifest.txt`. It names a sound that already exists (a built-in, a short sample, a subtractive cycle, or an FM cycle) and the voice, insert, scale, arp, and glide numbers for one track. The card still has no code. Older `mothdeck-instrument 1` folders load as before.

Three small blocks are new. Scale lock snaps a note to major, minor, harmonic minor, mixolydian, phrygian, or chromatic, nearest pitch class, ties down. The held arpeggiator keeps up to eight MIDI notes and walks them once per 16th. A second oscillator (sine, square, saw, or triangle), a coarse transpose of −24..24 semitones, a blend, and a glide time mix into built-in tones and short samples. None of these allocate a delay line.

Assign a folder with Enter on the Instrument page. Scale, Root, Arp, Glide, Osc2, Blend, and Coarse are the extra rows on the FX page. A song stores those rows only when one of them is in use, which makes the file version 4 (at most 3636 bytes). Interval walks `arp=1` and `arp=2` stay in the old voice byte and do not force version 4.

A built-in patch uses no heap. A subtractive or FM cycle is 168 frames, 336 bytes. A sample stays capped at 4096 frames, 8192 bytes, and at most four stay loaded. That sample heap is not the loop-window pool (five windows of 1024 frames, double buffered, 20480 bytes). Turning BLE on still unloads loops and leaves these plugins loaded.

The image to flash is `releases/mothdeck-cardputer-adv.bin` (1,153,152 bytes, magic `E9`, SHA-256 `a802ece13876ab053dac6bc8e2c8e8feab1d5b936c3b59d9f32de618946172ee`). Notes for that image are in [releases/CHANGELOG.md](releases/CHANGELOG.md). Chris confirmed the piano roll on a Cardputer. BLE in this image has not been tried on hardware.

## 1.1.2 (shipped in 1.2.0)

BLE pairs with an MPC Live II again. 1.1.0 did. 1.1.1 stopped, and the pairing code itself did not change: same Just Works bond (no passkey, host starts pairing), same MIDI characteristic (read, write, write without response, notify), same primary advert (flags, complete name, MIDI UUID).

What broke it was the loop-window pool. 1.1.0 initialised NimBLE with that 20KB still free. The controller takes one contiguous block of about 36KB, and the host pools need roughly another 24KB after that. 1.1.1 reserved the pool first and kept it whenever the largest leftover block was still 36KB. That is only enough for the controller. The host then came up short, and the MPC's pairing exchange, which needs those buffers, failed. The radio could still look like it was advertising.

1.1.2 does not start BLE at boot. The pool stays available and the radio is idle. Turning BLE on closes the streams, frees the pool, then initialises NimBLE the way 1.1.0 did. Turning it off stops advertising and loads the windows that fit beside the stack. A reboot with BLE still off never initialises NimBLE, so the full windows come back. The old NVS key `bleOn` is ignored, so a 1.1.1 "on" does not advertise.

The air name is `Mothdeck` (eight characters, complete in the primary packet). A stored `MothDeck` or `MothSynth` is replaced on boot. Rec starts off. Turning BLE on turns Rec off. If the open project has loops, the screen warns that loops are unavailable under MIDI and a new project will load, then asks Y to save or N to skip. `` ` `` or Backspace leaves BLE off.

MIDI notes were waiting on the audio queue. The audio task drained the ring once per 256-sample block and skipped that drain while two blocks were queued, about 17 ms worst case after the packet was already in the ring, on top of the link interval (15 ms if the 7.5–15 ms request stuck, often ~30 ms if the MPC kept its own). Connected playback now renders 128-sample blocks, keeps one buffer queued, and drains the ring while waiting and every 32 samples (about 0.7 ms). That is about 4 ms on the device plus one 256-sample I2S period (about 6 ms) that is left alone so local playback does not underrun. The interval request is sent 250 ms after connect, not inside the connect callback, and the negotiated interval is printed on serial and on the MIDI page (`link 15.0ms`). If the MPC accepts 15 ms, expect about 25 ms end to end. If it stays at 30 ms, expect about 40 ms, and the page shows that number. These are estimates from the buffer sizes. This environment has no Cardputer to measure.

These notes are included in the 1.2.0 image.

## 1.1.1 (shipped in 1.2.0)

Settings can turn the BLE radio off and on without unloading NimBLE, and a separate Unload BLE row skips the stack on the next boot. SD loops load as a set again while the radio is off. A stored 256-step song loads as four patterns of 64. Play opens on a piano roll (Enter returns to the 16-step strip). The behavior that shipped is the 1.2.0 section above: BLE is off at boot, and turning it on unloads loops.

## 1.1.0 (2026-10-09)

BLE MIDI pairs with an MPC Live II, patterns run from 1 to 8 bars, and playback stays up if the radio cannot start. Flash [`releases/mothdeck-cardputer-adv.bin`](releases/mothdeck-cardputer-adv.bin) (1,134,080 bytes, magic `E9`, chip `0x0009`, SHA-256 `f8d9ab44082ab7ff5921dca9d30eb68ed8a440430bb019df31e4d82212569a4a`).
